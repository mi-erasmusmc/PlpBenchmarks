<td align="left">Calibration Plot</td>
<td align="left">The calibration plot shows how close the predicted risk

predicted values for each quantile plotted against the observed fraction
of people in that quantile who had the outcome (observed fraction). The
straight black line is the linear regression using these 10 plotted
quantile mean predicted vs observed fraction points. The two blue

<td align="left">The precision-recall curve is valuable for dataset with
a high imbalance between the size of the positive and negative class. It
shows the tradeoff between precision and recall for different threshold.
High precision relates to a low false positive rate, and high recall
relates to a low false negative rate. High scores for both show that the
classifier is returning accurate results (high precision), as well as
returning a majority of all positive results (high recall). A high area
under the curve represents both high recall and high precision.</td>

<td align="left">ROC Plot</td>
<td align="left">The ROC plot plots the sensitivity against
1-specificity on the test set. The plot shows how well the model is able
to discriminate between the people with the outcome and those without.
The dashed diagonal line is the performance of a model that randomly
assigns predictions. The higher the area under the ROC plot the better
the discrimination of the model.</td>

<td align="left">Smooth Calibration Plot</td>
<td align="left">Similar to the traditional calibration shown above the
Smooth Calibration plot shows the relationship between predicted and
observed risk. the major difference is that the smooth fit allows for a
more fine grained examination of this. Whereas the traditional plot will
be heavily influenced by the areas with the highest density of data the
smooth plot will provide the same information for this region as well as
a more accurate interpretation of areas with lower density. the plot
also contains information on the distribution of the outcomes relative
to predicted risk. However the increased information game comes at a
computational cost. It is recommended to use the traditional plot for
examination and then to produce the smooth plot for final versions.</td>

<td align="left">Variable Scatter Plot</td>
<td align="left">The variable scatter plot shows the mean covariate
value for the people with the outcome against the mean covariate value
for the people without the outcome. The size and color of the dots
correspond to the importance of the covariates in the trained model
(size of beta) and its direction (sign of beta with green meaning
positive and red meaning negative), respectively.</td>

<p><strong>Pre-processing</strong></p>
<p>The following pre-processing were applied:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The data were normalized using the formula: value/maxValue
.</p></li>
<li><p>Candidate predictors occuring in less than 0.1 % of patients in
the target population were removed.</p></li>
<li><p>Candidate predictors that were redundant (completely correlated
with another predictor) were removed. When two predictors are completely
correlated, the most common predictor is removed. For example, if 60% of
the target population were male and 40% were female, then the male
gender predictor would be removed since it is redundant and more
common.</p></li>
